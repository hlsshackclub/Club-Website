We ensure that beginners and pros have a chance to learn through engaging interactive lessons that make the process enjoyable. Moreover, we aim to support students to facilitate a carrer in computer science/information technology.
        <br><br>Throughout the year, we hope to host fun activities such as scavenger hunts, robotics competition, and a hackathon. Additionally, our ties with Hack Club allow us to have acess to resouces such as, custom PCB's, Blot drawing machine and this very own website.
